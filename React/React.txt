    Step 1: npm create -react-app appname.
    step 2:cd appname.
    step 3:npm start

3.By using vit: it create project with minimum package.


*How to Start react Projct 
npm start

*How to display react Project 
http://localhost:3000


*react folder structure 
-node_modules : all the dependencies and dev-dependencies will install in this folder.
-package.json:All dependencies entry will found.
-package-lock.json:detail description of file you will found here.
-README.md:it is guid file hoe to use react project.

public:it contain static data an dile in it.

*react is component basis technology

-component: it is partial part of react project.
           -we can reuse throughout react project.



- in each we have two type of component

1.function component : when your main focus is on UI design.
2.class component : when you have to implement complex logic in that case we have it.


*How to display component output
*JSX(Javascript+XML):

-it allows us to write html code in react.
-it makes react code eassy, in jsx we have wrap multiple element inside one parent element.
-parent element must be any block element like div,h1-h6,p,etc..





*How to use CSS in react
-there are three way to use css

----------

*Fragment in react:
-------------------

-It is an alternative option jsx.
-it remove unwanted element from Dom heirarchy.


*Component Interaction:
-access data from parent component to child component.
-While performing component Interaction in between component they must have parent child relation.
-how establish parent child relation in between component ,first we have to import child component
 in parent component and then write child component name as tag in parent component.


*Passing state data as props
*Passing function data as props


*PureComponent
-it is use to prevent un-necessary re-rendering class component by performing shallow comparision
-to achieve this we have extends class component with PureComponent class.


*React.Memo():
-it is use to prevent un-necessary function component by performing shallow comparision
-to achieve we haveto pass function component name as argument to React.memo() method.


*HOC(Higher Order Component):
-----------------------------
*when we have to share same business logic with multiple component in that case we use it.
-in this we share business logic from function component to class or function component. 


*ErrorBondry:
-------------
-it is react component which is use to handle error occure in component three whils rendering component.
-to handle it we use two class component life-cycle method
       1.getDerivedStateFromError():when error occure in component it execute automatically
       2.componentDidCatch():it will display error log(error information).


*Virtual DOM:
-------------
-instead of manipulating the virtual Dom randomly,the react creates virtual Dom in its memory,where it does 
all the necessary changes in memory before making changes in browser dom.
-react render the code needs to be change only.

*Routing In React:
------------------

-navigation of component.
-By writing routing path name in browser url to display component output or view.
-we use react-router-dom library in react to perform routing. 


*how to instal react-router-dom
----------------------------------
-npm install react-router-dom@6

1.createBrowserDom(): -it is a method which takes array of type of data.
                     -in its object we use two property path,element.
                     -in this method we define all types of routing.
2.RouterProvider():it helps us to render output of all routing component on browser.



*Types of Routing:
------------------
1.naming routing:display component output after writting compnent routing path name in browser url.
2.default routing:display component output without routing path name.
3.parameterize routing:dispaly component output after pasiing parameter with routing psth name.
4.child routing:-display one routing inside another routing.
		-to perform child routing we use children property in object which array of object value.
		-to display 
5.wild-card routing:-when user write wrong path name in browser url then we decide what component output
                      should display.
                     - Wild Card routing always write at last,it below routing will never work.
