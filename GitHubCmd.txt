1. Fetch All Branches
Fetch all the branches from the remote repository to ensure they are available locally:

bash
Copy code
[git fetch --all]
2. Check Available Branches Locally
List all local branches:

bash
Copy code
[git branch]
List all remote branches:

bash
Copy code
[git branch -r]
You should see:

bash
Copy code
origin/main
origin/master
3. Switch to the master Branch
If the master branch exists remotely but not locally, create a new local branch to track it:

bash
Copy code
[git checkout -b master origin/master]
This will create a local master branch and track the remote master branch.

4. Verify Files
After switching to the master branch, check if the files you expect are present:

bash
Copy code
[ ls ]
5. Optional: Set master as Default Branch Locally
If you want master to be the default branch locally (instead of main), you can set it:

bash
Copy code
[git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/master]

6. Pull the Latest Changes
Ensure the master branch has the latest updates:

bash
Copy code
[git pull origin master]
