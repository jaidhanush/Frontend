*Inheritance :

-accessing parent class property into child class.
-to perform inheritence inbetween classes we use extends keyword.


Super():

-it reperesent parent class constructor inside child class constructor.
-super method must be first statement in child class constructor.

encapsulation :
-Wrapping Data into single Unit.


Pollymarphism : it is ability to take more than one form.
 -method overloading : when we have multiple method with same name in same cls.
 -method overriding: when we have multiple method with same name in different cls.

 Abstraction:

 -Hiding implementaion and showing necessary function.
 -we can achive this by using interface,abstact class.

 *module:

 -writting ts code in single or multiple file and access it in another file.
 -to achive this we use export and import keyword.
 -to access it we use import.


 *interface:

 -it is signature of class.
 -it contain abstract method.
 -to create interface we use interface keyword.
 -its child cls has responsibility to implemnt it.
 -to implement we use implement keyword.
