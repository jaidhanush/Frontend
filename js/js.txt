Java Script 
-----------

*it is used to add functionality in webapp
*it is interpreted language
*it is loosely type language


why js is loosely type language 
  - when we create variable in js it can't determine what type of date it contain 
    until unless intialize in it.

  - in js variable we can store multiple type of value in it.


How to use js
   -there are two ways to use it :

   1) internal js: in html we use script tag and in that we write js code.
   2) External js: in this we create seperate js file and import the js file in 
   html file by using script tag.


   How to get output in js :

   1.document.Write() : it will display output in html page.it will display output in same line 
   2.Window.alert(): it will display output in model popup Window

  *Hoisting - it os used to store the dat in it.
            - moving variable declaration and function top of the webpage.


   variable : it is use to store data in it.
   -we can create variable in js by using var,let,const
  


 1.var :- it create a function scope varianble.
   we can use variable before it declaration.
   we can re declare variabvle.


   var mydata: //variable declaration
   mydata= "changepond"; // variable intialitation.
   var yourname ="rahul"; //defining variable.


 2.let : it create block scope vcariable.

     -we can't use variable before declaration.
     -we can't redeclare variable.



3.const: it create block scope variable.

      -we can't use variable before its declaration.
      -in this when we declare the variable at same time we have intialize it.
      -its data will never change on time.


-Exponention(**): it return power of any number.



==(equal to):

-it will check value only and if both are same it will return true value.
Ex: 
5==5;
true

5='5';
true


===(Exactly equal to):

-it will check the value as well as data type 
ex: 5===5 // true

    5==='5' // false



* DOM(Document Object Model) manupulation


*Function : it is block code which is use to perform specific task.
           - function will execute only when we call it.



  * there are mainly three types of function 

  1.predefine function: provide js to us 
  2.usedefine function : user developed for particular use.


  *Object :- it is used to store multiple value with different data type.
            -in object data stored in key and value format.
            -we can access the object data outside od by writting object.keyname.
            -object type of data is denoted by {}

  *Callback Function() : passing a function name as an argumment inside another function is called Callback Function.




  *Date and time
  -if we want to dispaly date and time in javascript first we have object of date class.



  *String and its Method 

  String: it collection of character.

          -in String every Character has index its start from zero.
          -in String blank Space also consider as a String.



There are three method which index of Searching String
  1.indexof(searchingString,StartIndex?):
   -it will search string from left to right and return index of first occursance of String.
   -it Searching string is not found then return -1 as result.


  2.lastIndexof(searchingString,StartIndex?):
   -it will search string from right to left and return index of first occursance of String.
   -it Searching string is not found then return -1 as result.

  3.Search(searchingString)
   -it will search string from right to left and return index of first occursance of String.
   -it Searching string is not found then return -1 as result.
   - its faster than indexof() Method.


   There are three method which return part of searching String 

   1.slice(startindex,endIndex?) :
   -it will return part of string from big string.
   -if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right.
   -if we write -ve index then will searchindex from rightto left.


   2.substring(startindex,endIndex?):

   -it will return part of string from big string.
   -if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right.

   3.substr(startindex'totalNumberOfCharacter);

   -it will return part of string from big string.
   -if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right.
